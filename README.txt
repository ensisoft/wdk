WDK (Window Development Kit) is aimed to be a minimalistic library to knock up a window for OpenGL rendering.
It also provides simple input handling (TBD for mouse) for mouse and keyboard. 


TODO:

- multihead support, probably only works with a single display setup at the moment
- uniform unicode character input, windows provides utf16, X11 ucs-4
- X11 accent characters, combining characters?
- X11 IM input?
- keyboard state functions, for win there is GetKeyboardState, but how about linux?
- mouse support
